(the “Service”) and you agree to be bound by the Terms of Service, License Agreement and this Privacy Policy. Some capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy and not otherwise defined may be defined in the Terms of Service. This Privacy Policy only addresses activities from our servers.\n\n## Consent and Information Collection and Use\n\nWhen you join us as a user of our Services, we ask for personal information that will be used to activate your account, provide the Services to you, communicate with you about the status of your account, and for other purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Your name, company name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card information and certain other information about you may be required by us to provide the Services or disclosed by you during your use of the Services. You will also be asked to create a private password, which will become part of your account information.\n\nBy providing personal information to us and by retaining us to provide you with the Services, you voluntarily consent to the collection, use and disclosure of such personal information as specified in this Privacy Policy. Without limiting the foregoing, we may on occasion ask you to consent when we collect, use, or disclose your personal information in specific circumstances. Sometimes your consent will be implied through your conduct with us if the purpose of the collection, use or disclosure is obvious and you voluntarily provide the information.\n\nWe may use your personal or account information for the following purposes:\n\n  - To provide the Services to you and to improve the quality of the Site and Services,\n  - To provide information to you so that you may use the Site and Services more effectively,\n  - To create, manage and control your account information, and to verify access rights to services and software,\n  - To bill your account,\n  - To communicate with you for the purpose of informing you of changes or additions to the Services, or of the availability of any service we provide,\n  - To assess service levels, monitor traffic patterns and gauge popularity of different service options,\n  - To carry out our marketing activities;\n  - To enforce this Privacy Policy;\n  - To respond to claims of any violation of our rights or those of any third parties;\n  - To respond to your requests for customer service;\n  - To protect the rights, property or personal safety of you, us, our users and the public; and as required or authorized by law.\n\nWe may occasionally communicate with you regarding our products, services, news and events. You have the option to not receive this information. We provide an opt-out function within all email communications of this nature, or will cease to communicate with you for this purpose if you contact us and tell us not to communicate this information to you. The only kind of these communications that you may not “opt-out” of are those required to communicate announcements related to the Services, including information specific to your account, planned Services suspensions and outages. We will attempt to minimize this type of communication to you.\n\n## Age of Consent\n\nWe do not knowingly provide the Services to, and will not knowingly collect the personal information from anyone under the age of consent.\n\n## Rights to Your Information\n\nYou have the right to access and edit your information at anytime through the web interface provided as part of the Services.\nDisclosure\n\nWe will only share your information with third parties in accordance with your instructions or as necessary to provide you with a specific service or otherwise in accordance with applicable privacy legislation.

Your identity and personal information will be kept anonymous in Aggregated Data.\n\n## Links\n\nThe Site may contain links to other sites and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites.

New ideas like the JAMstack, Serverless computing and GitOps enable us to create more performant and secure websites."

The way we create and engineer websites is changing thanks to the constant evolution of tools, best practices and needs. We're seeing websites being statically generated, served from CDNs, edited using Headless CMSs and wired up with a myriad of developer workflows. New ideas like the JAMstack, Serverless computing and GitOps enable us to create more performant and secure websites."

New ideas like the JAMstack, Serverless computing and GitOps enable us to create more performant and secure websites."

New ideas like the JAMstack, Serverless computing and GitOps enable us to create more performant and secure websites."
