New ideas like the JAMstack, Serverless computing and GitOps enable us to create more performant and secure websites."

The way we create and engineer websites is changing thanks to the constant evolution of tools, best practices and needs. We're seeing websites being statically generated, served from CDNs, edited using Headless CMSs and wired up with a myriad of developer workflows. New ideas like the JAMstack, Serverless computing and GitOps enable us to create more performant and secure websites."

New ideas like the JAMstack, Serverless computing and GitOps enable us to create more performant and secure websites."
